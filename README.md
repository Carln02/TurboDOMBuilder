# TurboDOMBuilder
TurboDOMBuilder is a TypeScript-first UI toolkit designed to bridge the gap between Human-Computer Interaction theories and web development. 
Its main purpose is to empower developers with structures and tools to easily create systems that are more interactive.

The toolkit includes:
- A **selector** that augments elements with useful functions, including the creation and manipulation of tools and substrates.
- A **robust event management** that supports richer, continuous interactions.
- An **MVC-inspired architecture** to structure larger, complex components.
- **Builder functions** to easily create elements in script and populate the DOM.
- **Reactive hooks** to track state and re-render efficiently.
- **Logic-heavy components** that are highly customizable and devoid of any styling.
- A **decorator suite** to reduce redundant code and augment classes and methods.

A comprehensive API documentation is available at **[carln02.github.io/TurboDOMBuilder](https://carln02.github.io/TurboDOMBuilder/)**.
